	abstract = {The aim of this research is to analyze influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on international trade in goods of OECD countries. It is still too early to make an assessment of the impact of the virus based on full statistical evidence. Hence, we investigate trade among 37 OECD countries in 2019 and 2020 (trade data from OECD) to compare changes in global trade before COVID-19 (in 2019) and in the time of COVID-19 (in 2020). The disease burden of COVID-19 is measured in terms of the number of cases and deaths. We get COVID-19 data from the World Health Organization (WHO) monthly, trade data from OECD quarterly for a trade model that is based on the standard trade gravity variable from the CEPII gravity database [1]. Our findings can be summarized as follows: First, the COVID-19 pandemic has negative effects on the international trade of OECD countries, particularly exporting countries, because the development of the COVID-19 pandemic prevents trading activities worldwide. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has positive affects on importing countries because of demand for medical goods or essential foods. However, the level of the COVID-19 effect on exporting countries is much bigger than for importing countries; COVID-19 is truly a disaster for our world. Second, trade policy measures of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to negative effects in the short-term, but in the long-term these measures create positive impacts on international trade and economics as well.},

	abstract = {The concept of spatial interaction (SI) encapsulates the domain of human activities that occur
between a set of locations embedded within geographical space. Data about such processes are essential for studying a wide spectrum of geographic phenomena that are important to society, such as the accessibility of services, product demand, transportation trends, and demographic dynamics. In particular, SI models seek to explore, explain, and predict aggregate movements or flows that occur across an abstract or physical network, which can be useful on its own, as well as a factor within other regional models. As the number and nature of SI modeling applications have grown, the associated theory and tools have simultaneously evolved to consider more complex spatial relationships, resulting in numerous expansions of the modeling paradigm. In this chapter, some foundations of SI modeling are first laid out before presenting a simple demonstration and then describing several extensions to the core modeling methodology.},

	abstract = {1 Abstract In the negotiation period of Brexit in the years 2016-2019, banks in the UK had to plan their activity based on the expectation of whether they would have passporting rights in the future or not. The referendum's consequences may foreshadow what the actual Brexit will entail. This master thesis investigates the impact of the Brexit referendum in 2016 on the banking activity of the 45 largest European banks during the negotiation period. I use gravity analysis for inter-country transactions, and a brand-new "Synthetic Difference in Differences", together with Synthetic Control and standard Difference in Differences, for intra-country transactions. Although all of these methods were used in the literature in the context of the Brexit referendum, the Country-by-Country Reporting (CbCR) dataset that I use has not yet been used in such a context. I use turnover reported in CbCR by European banks as a proxy for banking activity in the years 2013-2019 and, thus, have four pre-treatment years (i.e., 2013-2016) and three post- treatment years (i.e., 2017-2019). Using the gravity model, I discovered empirical evidence that banks reported lower turnover since the Brexit referendum in their partner countries by between 14.5\% and 44.6\% relative to their domestic country. Yet, banks that have British...},
